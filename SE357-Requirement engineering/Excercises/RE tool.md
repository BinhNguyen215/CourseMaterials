1. What criteria should be used in choosing an appropriate requirements engineering tool? 

2. Are there any drawbacks to using certain tools in requirements engineering activities? 

3. When selecting an open-source tool, what characteristics should you look for? 

4. How can tools enable distributed, global requirements engineering activities? What are the drawbacks in this regard? 

5. If an environment does not currently engage in solid requirements engineering practices, should tools be introduced? 

6. What sort of problems might you find through a traceability matrix that you might not see without one? 

7. How is AI being proposed for knowledge acquisition and representation in requirements specifications? 

8. Construct Requirements Linkage Traceability Matrix, Requirements Source Traceability Matrix, Requirements Stakeholder Traceability Matrix for your project in theory class.



<!-- 8. Download FreeMind and use it to brainstorm a mind map for your smart home system. 

9. Construct a FitNesse (or Cucumber) test table for the requirement described in the belows. 

Video entry is the mechanism by which various formats of video data are able to
be loaded into the repository for video playback. Priority = Medium.
